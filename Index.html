            <h2>My Mom and I 2022</h2>
            <img src="images/My Mom and I.jpg" alt="Mom" class="post-image">
            <p>My mom and I are so close today, although it hasn't always been that way.  To give you a small hint  as to the "strain" in our
             relationship, this photo of us is the first photo of the two of us together.  Today I am a proud daughter of this woman.  She is the sole 
            reason I even took these classes.  Her love is fierce and knows no bounds.  I can't imagine not having her in my life today, and appreciate
        every single moment we get to spend together.  She is definitely one of my heros in life. So for your listening pleasure
    here is my mom's favorite artist singing one of his hit <a href="https://youtu.be/-eHJ12Vhpyc?si=Pc23OoDG0f7l8ogP" target="_blank">songs</a>.</p>

            <p>Well here we are.  Cheryl is the oldest, then Samuel, Myself and Ben.  We were all apart of the 60's scoop, and our Mother and her siblings were residential school children.  Not all survived.  We all grew up in Foster care, and well without going into detail, it was an interesting time to say the least.  Ben passed away at 41 years old, and that was the catalyst that got the much needed healing work to begin in our family.  Sad that the passing of our baby brother is what it took for us to start to grow up, but that is our story.  Today we are thick as thieves.  Our Family time is such a treasure.  There is a lot of laughter, and story telling.  Our Mom is opening up and talking about different times in her life.  It is a joy to hear all the amazing adventures she has been through. She is incredible.  We are so appreciative now, of all the time we make to be together. I never thought I'd ever be here today doing this, a blog website?  Never in a million years would it have crossed my mind, yet here we are.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <br>
            <p>We all come from somewhere and we all have a story.  Life is full of ups and downs, triumphs and trials.  If I know anything, it is that I have to keep pushing through no matter what.  I can't believe I've gotten even this far.  The future looks brighter. Amen.</p>
